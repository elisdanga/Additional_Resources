# Find the unique number

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

getUnique [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1] -- Result is 2
getUnique [0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0] -- Result is 0.55

It’s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
